      account or to provide 2-3 pieces of personal information that we will match against our records 
      to verify your identity. We will not fulfill a CCPA privacy rights request unless we have been 
      provided sufficient information for us to reasonably verify that the requestor is the person about

      offer coupons, specials, or other discounts to consumers who have opted-in
      to the receipt of promotional communications from us by providing us with
      certain personal information, such as an email address or a phone number.
      Occasionally, we also offer consumers the opportunity to enter contests
      and sweepstakes. Consumers who share certain personal information with us
      by entering have a chance to win the contest or sweepstake. Each contest
      or sweepstake is governed by its own terms, and the specific financial
      incentive offered will be detailed in such terms.

      Consumers may also join our free rewards program. You will be enrolled in
      the Rewards Program only after you provide prior opt-in consent.
      Participation in The Rewards Program gives consumers the opportunity to
      accrue points with qualifying purchases that can be redeemed for rewards.

      <strong><em><u>Material Terms of Our Financial Incentive Offers</u></em></strong>
    </p>
    <p>
      When we offer coupons, specials, or other discounts that may be deemed a
      financial incentive, the offer will include an explanation of its material
      terms. The nature and value of any such offer or financial incentive may
      differ depending on the benefit provided and what information we collect.
      Most financial incentives that we offer will involve one or more of the
      following categories of personal information: identifiers, personal records, 
      commercial information (such as purchase records), and inferences
    </p>
    <p>
      Our Rewards Program is subject to the <a href="https://www.auntieannes.com/legal#rewards-terms">Auntie Anne’s Rewards Program Terms and Conditions</a>. 
      The Rewards Program collects the following categories of personal information: identifiers 
      (such as name and email address), personal records (such as telephone number), characteristics 
      of protected classifications under California or federal law (such as gender), commercial 
      information (such as purchase records), professional or employment-related information, and inferences.

    <p>
      <strong><em><u>Financial Incentive Offer Opt-In Consent and Right to Withdraw
      </u></em></strong>
    </p>
    <p>
      Participation in our financial incentives, including the Rewards Program requires your 
      prior opt-in consent. You can opt-in to participate in our financial incentives by checking 
      the opt-in box when you sign up for an account, or by entering a contest or sweepstakes we 
      sponsor. You may opt out of marketing 
      emails at any time by following the opt-out instructions contained in any marketing 
      email we send to you. 
    </p>
    <p>
      Similarly, you may withdraw from our Rewards Program by deleting or deactivating your account 
      through the app or our website. Please see the Rewards Program <a href="https://www.auntieannes.com/legal#rewards-terms">Terms and Conditions</a>

      <strong><em><u>Our Good Faith Valuation of California Consumers' Personal
            Information</u></em></strong>
    </p>
    <p>
       Our offers and financial incentives may be individualized to each
      consumer, or a group of consumers, based on one or more factors.
      Nonetheless, each offer or financial incentive related to the collection,
      retention, and other use of your personal information is based upon our
      reasonable determination of the estimated value of such information, which
      takes into consideration, without limitation, estimates regarding the
      anticipated revenue generated from such information, the anticipated
      expenses which might be incurred in the collection, storage, and use of
      such information in the operation of our business, and other relevant
      factors related to the estimated value of such information to our
      business, as permitted under the CCPA. Thus, the value of a consumer’s
      personal information will depend on the specific offer or financial
      incentive. With respect to the Rewards     Program, we treat the value of consumer 
      data collected through the program as the equivalent of relevant expenses related to 
      the collection and retention 
      of consumers’ personal information as part of the program.
